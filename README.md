# Online Crop Farmers Advisory System

The **Online Crop Farmers Advisory System** is a web-based platform designed to provide agricultural advice, timely crop information, and disease alerts to farmers and the broader community. The system aims to help increase productivity by connecting farmers with agricultural experts and consultants, providing guidance from seed treatment to harvest, and enabling real-time interactions with system administrators.

## Overview

The system is divided into two main modules:

1. **Farmer Module (Frontend):**
   - Provides crop information and advice.
   - Alerts on new diseases and preventive measures.
   - Allows farmers to interact with advisors and administrators.

2. **Administrator Module (Backend):**
   - Enables content uploading and management.
   - Ensures that the advice and information are kept up-to-date.
   - Supports administrative control over the data and interactions within the system.

## Features

- **Expert Consultation:** Provides access to agricultural consultants who can guide farmers through various stages of the crop cycle.
